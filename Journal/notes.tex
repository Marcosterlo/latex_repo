Ordered list of problems and steps taken to solve them, or at least to understand them better.

\section*{Initial works}

The first weeks were spent understanding the papers and the Matlab code given by Sophie (\cite{automatica}, \cite{css-paper}, \cite{data-driven}) regarding the application of ETM to the NN controller of a linearized and non linearized pendulum. The aim is to save as much computational load as possible by putting ETM in between the layers. Doing so it is possible to decide whether propagating the current layer output to the activation function. 
The main computational save will regard directly the application of the activation function that, being non-linear, is the most expensive operation in the network.
Some sum ups can be found in the folders \textit{"Automatica paper discussion", "Dynamic ETM intro discussion", "Sector conditions intro discussion"}.

\subsection*{Faulty application of global sector conditions}

I tried to apply directly the proposition of Sophie's notes to the system portrayed in \cite{css-paper}. Everything is documented in the notes \textit{"Faulty implementation of dynamic ETM report"} in \textit{"extra material"} folder.

At first, I tried t

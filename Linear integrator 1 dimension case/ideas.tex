\title{Solve LMI with saturation 1 dimensional case}
\maketitle

To solve the LMI for the plant:

\begin{equation}
  \bmx{
  \theta \\
  \dot{\theta}
  }^{+} = \bmx{
  1 & \delta t\\
  \frac{g}{l} dt & 1 - \frac{\mu}{m l^2} dt
  } \bmx{
  \theta \\
  \dot{\theta}
  } + \bmx{
    0 \\
    \frac{dt}{m l^2}
  } u = A x + B u
\end{equation}

And a controller of the form:

\begin{equation}
  u = \text{sat}(-K x)
\end{equation}

With $K$ the result of a LQR optimization, we need to solve a LMI. Defining the incremental state $\tilde{x} = x - x_{*}$, and the Lyapunov function $V(x) = x \tr P x$ I can write the increment of the Lyapunov function as:

\begin{multline}
\Delta V = (\tilde{x}^{+})\tr P \tilde{x}^{+} - \tilde{x}\tr P \tilde{x} = 
\left( A \tilde{x} + B \tilde{u} \right) \tr P ( \bullet )- \tilde{x}\tr P \tilde{x} = \\
\left( A \tilde{x} + B \left( N_{u \omega} \omega \right)\right) \tr P \left( \bullet \right) - \tilde{x}\tr P \tilde{x} = \\
\left( A \tilde{x} + B \left( \tilde{\nu} - \tilde{\psi} \right)\right) \tr P \left( \bullet \right) - \tilde{x}\tr P \tilde{x} = \\
\left( (A - B K) \tilde{x} - B \tilde{\psi} \right) \tr P \left( \bullet \right) - \tilde{x}\tr P \tilde{x} \\
\end{multline}

In matrix form denoting $A_{k} = A - B K$:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta V = \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}} \tr \bmx{
    A_k\tr P A_k - P & -A_k\tr P B \\
    -B\tr P A_k & B\tr P B
  } \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}}
\end{equation}

Using the same notation of \cite{css-extended} and \cite{css-paper} I can express the saturation involved in the controller as:

\begin{equation}
    \bmx{u\\ \nu} = \bmx{\begin{array}{c|c|c} 
        0 & \Id & 0 \\
        \hline
        -K & 0 & 0
    \end{array}}  \bmx{x \\ \omega \\ 1}
\end{equation}

And hence express the sector conditions of the saturation as:

\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{\psi}\tr T \left[ G \tilde{x} - \tilde{\nu} + \tilde{\psi} \right] \leq 0
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}\label{sector}
  \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}}\tr \bmx{
    0 & 0 & 0 \\
    TG & -T & T
  } \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\nu} \\ \tilde{\psi}} \leq 0 \to
  \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}}\tr \bmx{
    0 & 0 & 0 \\
    TG & -T & T
  } \bmx{\Id & 0\\
  -K & 0\\
  0 & \Id} \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}} \leq 0 \to \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}}\tr M_{1} R_{\phi} \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}}
\end{equation}

Given the sign definiteness of this quantity, I can bound $\Delta V$ as: 
\begin{equation}\label{matricione}
  \Delta V = \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}}\tr \bmx{
    A_k\tr P A_k - P & -A_k\tr P B \\
    -B\tr P A_k & B\tr P B
  } -\text{He}\left\{ M_1 R_{\phi} \right\} \bmx{\tilde{x}\\ \tilde{\psi}} \leq 0 \to \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}}\tr M \bmx{\tilde{x} \\ \tilde{\psi}} \leq 0
\end{equation}  

Since the sector condition is not global I have to add the inclusion inside an ellipsoid to assure the local stability of the solution. I want $\tilde{x}\tr \alpha P \tilde{x} \leq 1$, from the sector condition definition, see set $\cS$ in \cite{css-extended} I have:

$$
  \cS = \left\{ x(k) \in \RR^{n_{p}} : -\bar{\nu} - \nu_* \leq G (x(k) - x_*) \leq \bar{\nu} - \nu_* \right\}
$$

Since $\nu_* = 0$ the condition directly translates into $|G \tilde{x}| \leq \bar{\nu} \to (G \tilde{x})\tr (G \tilde{x}) \leq \bar{\nu}^2 \to \tilde{x}\tr \frac{G\tr G}{\bar{\nu}^{2}} \tilde{x} \leq 1$ I want this condition to be included in the ellipsoid defined by $\cE(P, x_*) = \left\{ x \in \RR^{n_{F}}: \tilde{x}\tr \gamma P \tilde{x} \leq 1 \right\}$

\begin{multline*}
  \tilde{x}\tr \frac{G\tr G}{\bar{\nu}^{2}} \tilde{x} \leq \tilde{x}\tr \gamma P \tilde{x} \leq 1 \to \frac{G\tr G}{\bar{\nu}^{2}} \leq \gamma P \leq 1 \to \gamma P - \frac{G\tr G}{\bar{\nu}^{2}} \geq 0\\
  0
\end{multline*}

It is now possible to apply Schur's complement, dividing everything by $\gamma$:

\begin{equation}
  P - \frac{G\tr G}{\gamma \bar{\nu}^{2}} \geq 0 \to \bmx{P & G\tr\\ G & \gamma \bar{\nu}^{2}} \geq 0
\end{equation}

Now by pre and post multiplying by $\bmx{\Id & 0\\ 0 & T}$:

\begin{equation}\label{ellipsoid}
  \bmx{P & G\tr T\\
  TG & \gamma \bar{\nu}^{2} T^{2}} \geq 0
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{ellipsoid} is the last LMI condition to add. The problem arises due to the bilinear term $TG$ that appear also in equation \ref{sector}. The approach followed in \cite{css-extended} does not seem to be directly appliable to the one-dimensional case scenario even though it results to be compliant with a multi-layer network controller. New tricks have to be explored to solve this problem:

\subsection*{Iterative approach}
Set $G$ to nullify the cross term in matrix $M$ of equation \ref{matricione}. Solve for $P, T, \gamma$. Then set the found value of $T$ and solve for $P, G, \gamma$. Iterate until convergence to be established.

From equation \ref{matricione} the hermitian of the sector conditions translate as:

\begin{equation}
  M_1 R_{\phi} + R_{\phi}\tr M_1\tr = \bmx{
    0 & T(G\tr + K\tr)\\
    T(G + K) & 2T
  }  \to M = \bmx{
    A_k\tr P A_k - P & -A_k\tr P B + T(G\tr + K\tr)\\
    -B\tr P A_k + T(G + K) & B\tr P B + 2T
  }
\end{equation}

I set $G = -K - T^{-1} B\tr P A_k$ to nullify the cross term and start the iteration.

The ellipsoid condition without bilinear terms is:

\begin{equation}
  \bmx{
    P & G\tr \\
    G & \gamma \bar{\nu}^{2}
  } \geq 0
\end{equation}

The problem that arises now is that imposing $G = -K - T^{-1} B\tr P A_k$ results in a bilinear condition since we have both $T^{-1}$ and $P$

\subsection*{Scalar approach}

Follow the approach used in paper \cite{isabelle-paper} to find out how they dealt with $\gamma \bar{\nu}^{2} = \tau$ with \texttt{fminsearch}

\textbf{Paper analysis}: \dots Interrupted immediately since I found a value for $\alpha$ with respect to equation \ref{ellipsoid} and paper \cite{css-extended}: $\alpha = 1$\dots

\section*{Pendulum with integrator}
Since I found the solution for the LMI for the case without integrator, I can now try to solve the case with integrator. The plant is now:

\begin{equation}
  \bmx{
  \theta \\
  \dot{\theta} \\
  \eta
  }^{+} = \bmx{
  1 & \delta t & 0\\
  \frac{g}{l} dt & 1 - \frac{\mu}{m l^2} dt & 0\\
  1 & 0 & 1
  } \bmx{
  \theta \\
  \dot{\theta} \\
  \eta
  } + \bmx{
    0 \\
    \frac{dt}{m l^2} \\
    0
  } u = A x + B u
\end{equation}

Following analogous considerations I end up with a condition formally identical as in equation. \ref{matricione}. The only difference is that the dimensions of the matrices that now are scaled accordingly and the gain matrix $K$ that is now the proper LQR gain for the new system with integrator. I set up the ellipsoid condition as in equation \ref{ellipsoid} with $\gamma = 1$. Introducing the variable $Z = TG$ and exploiting the result from:

$$
  \left[ \bar{\nu}^{-2} - T \right] \bar{\nu}^{2} \left[ \bar{\nu}^{-2} - T \right] \geq 0 \to \bar{\nu}^{-2} - T - T + \bar{\nu}^{2} T^{2} \geq 0 \to \bar{\nu}^{2} T^{2} \geq 2 T - \bar{\nu}^{-2}
$$

Equation. \ref{ellipsoid} becomes:

\begin{equation}
  \bmx{
    P & Z\tr \\
    Z & 2 T - \bar{\nu}^{-2} 
  } \geq 0
\end{equation}

That guarantees the validity in a local region of the state space. Specifically the region defined by the ellipsoid $\cE(P, x_*) = \left\{ x \in \RR^{n_{F}} : (x - x_*)\tr P (x - x_*) \leq 1 \right\}$ that is represented in the following plots.

\subsection*{Next steps}
Now the following steps regard the extraction of the "region of linearity" from this trivial 1 layer case and extend it iteratively to craft a multi-layer network controller by hand.

We have explored some way to craft it. The problem lies in the dimensionality of the matrices, given the feasibility of the 1 dimensional case:

$$
  u = sat(Kx)
$$

We wanted to extend the problem to an $l$ layer controller by designing something like:

$$
  u = sat_1 \left( W_1 \left( sat_0 \left( W_0 x \right) \right) \right)
$$

Such that, staying in the linear zone of the saturation, we have $u = W_1 W_0 x = K x$ and to design something like $W_1 = k W_0^{-1}$ with $W_0$ and $W_1$ to be defined. Furthermore, we have to ensure that after the first layer we keep staying inside the linearity region. To do so we have to force something like this:

$$
  -\bar{\nu}_i \leq W_i \nu \leq \bar{\nu}_i
$$

For each layer, this directly translates to the inclusion of vector $\nu$ to the following set: \\ $ S_i = \left\{ \nu \in \RR^{n_{\phi}} : \nu\tr W_i\tr W_i \nu < \bar{\nu}^{2} \right\}$
Then we can express the ellipsoid conditions:

$$
  \nu\tr \frac{W_i\tr W_i}{\bar{\nu}^{2}} \nu \leq 1
$$

Since we want the inclusion of one linearity zone into the following we impose for every layer:

$$
  \nu\tr \frac{W_{i-1}\tr W_{i-1}}{\bar{\nu}_{i-1}^{2}} \nu \geq \nu\tr \frac{W_{i}\tr W_{i}}{\bar{\nu}_{i}^{2}} \to W_{i-1}\tr W_{i-1} - W_{i}\tr W_{i} \frac{\bar{\nu}_{i-1}^{2}}{\bar{\nu}_{i}^{2}} \geq 0
$$

Applying Schur's complement:

$$
  \bmx{
    W_{i-1}\tr W_{i-1} & W_{i}\tr \\
    W_{i} & \frac{\bar{\nu}_{i}^{2}}{\bar{\nu}_{i-1}^{2}} \Id
  } \geq 0
$$

Everything seems to be fine by fixing $\bar{\nu}_0$ equal to the actuator saturation level, but the problem lies in the dimensionality of the matrices $W_i$ since we need their inverse to compute the matrix for the following layer and to be invertible they need to be square. This enforces a strong limit on the architecture of the network since it forces to have the dimension of the input, the state, equal to the number of each hidden layer and also to the dimension of the output. Hence, this method is not applicable to the general case of a multi-layer network controller.
